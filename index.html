            <p>Welcome to the GeoLocation theater, this is a demo website showcasing a model of theater that involves devised theater and using locations across a city to tell the story. The idea behind this is to have the audience travel to specific locations where a performance has taken place and to archive site specific performances. This can be used to tell a single story or a series of stories that will bring you around a city to experience an extended story. The current website has the geolocation function built into it to identify where a person viewing the performance from and to supply the correct performance. However, we do not have enough content to populate each location on the map on the locations tab so we have made available the first video for the Delaware Park Rose Garden. </p>
